# Customer-Segmentation-Project
Customer segmentation simply means grouping your customers according to various characteristics (for example grouping customers by age).

It’s a way for organizations to understand their customers.
Knowing the differences between customer groups, it’s easier to make strategic decisions regarding product growth and marketing.

I am using K-means clustering algorithm here for grouping customers.

K-Means clustering is an efficient machine learning algorithm to solve data clustering problems.
It’s an unsupervised algorithm that’s quite suitable for solving customer segmentation problems.
